# 5-DOF Robotic Arm Project

This project involves designing and building a 3D model of a robotic arm with five degrees of freedom (5 DOF), using the Tinkercad platform. The purpose of this design is to simulate the functionality of a robotic manipulator commonly used in industrial automation, capable of flexible movement and directional control.

## ‚ú® Features

- Fully designed in 3D using Tinkercad with a clean and organized structure.
- The robotic arm consists of five joints representing five degrees of freedom, allowing dynamic movement that mimics a human arm.
- A stable base supports the arm, with rotating joints that enable precise directional control.
- The end of the arm features a gripper designed for holding and moving objects, making it suitable for simulating industrial robotic tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Tinkercad: A 3D modeling and simulation platform used to build and visualize the robotic arm design.
- Basic geometric shapes in Tinkercad (cylinders, cubes, cones, etc.) were used to construct different parts of the arm.

## üìÇ Project Components

- A complete robotic arm model consisting of a base, joints, arm segments, and a gripper at the end.
- Multiple colors were used to distinguish between fixed and movable parts.
- The design can be modified to suit other applications such as 3D printing or hardware integration.
